# Xpress

Xpress is Voxel's expression template library. It allows arrays to be created in
a similar fashion to those in Numpy, but will by default execute in paralell on
the CPU or GPU if CUDA is supported. Additionally, Xpress provides additional
arrays with configurable memory layouts which can provide optimal performance
in some instances.
